This project is about an offline capable (able to work when offline) to do
list application.

The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark completed tasks.
It also retrieves the data even after closing and openning the browser.

I am building this as a way of learning to use indexedDB and data persistence
in web browsers. It is for learning perpose only.
